In a village, there was a Yadav family with four children. When their parents passed away, the brothers decided they needed to go out and earn a living. Three of the brothers got married, while the youngest remained unmarried. They explained to their wives that they were going to earn money in a foreign land, and asked them to take good care of their younger brother. The three sisters-in-law began to look after their brother well. However, everyone kept asking the younger brother if he would marry their sister. After some time, when they asked him, he prepared to leave home. The sisters-in-law said, "Just see that you marry Belmanti Rani."

The younger brother set out in search of Belmanti Rani. On his way, he reached a forest and came across a sage's hut. There, he cleaned the area, offered some grass as offerings, and placed it on a clean spot. When the sage woke up and saw the offerings, he began to wonder who had done this. Spotting the boy, he called him over. The sage asked, "Child, what do you want?" The boy replied, "I want to marry Belmanti Rani." The sage said, "Follow this path, and you’ll find a bel (wood apple) tree that bears a single fruit. Bring that fruit back, but remember, don’t look back. If you do, you will turn to ashes." 

The boy went to pick the fruit but, on the way, he turned back to look. As soon as he did, he turned to ashes. The sage, upon noticing what happened, left and saw the boy turned to ash along the way. He collected the ashes and blew on them, and the boy revived. The sage advised him to never look back again. The boy went back, picked the fruit from the bel tree, and did not look back this time. The sage instructed him to break the fruit when he got home.

The boy took the fruit back home. Near his home, he felt thirsty, so he sat by a well to drink water. As he approached the well, he accidentally dropped the fruit, which fell and burst open. From it emerged Belmanti Rani, adorned beautifully with fine clothes and jewelry. Then, her husband went to the village to fetch a palanquin for her. Belmanti Rani felt thirsty as well. Just then, a maid came to the same well to fetch water. When Belmanti Rani asked her for water, the maid gave her the jug. As Rani began to fill the jug, the maid took all her jewelry and clothes and shoved her into the well, wearing them herself. Wearing all the clothes and ornaments, she sat down beautifully. 

When the younger brother came back with the palanquin and pulled it in, he mistook her for his bride and took her home in the palanquin.

Preparations for the wedding began. One day, as the four brothers were going out for water, they stopped at the same well. The eldest brother lowered a bucket and saw beautiful flowers inside. He wanted to collect them but no matter what he tried, the flowers wouldn’t come out. The middle brother and the youngest brother also tried, but the flowers wouldn’t budge. Finally, the youngest brother lowered the bucket into the well, and the flowers jumped up into the bucket. Once he brought the flowers home, the maid tossed them outside. There, the flowers and greens piled up. When greens were brought, the maid threw them away too. Then more flowers bloomed. A gardener saw them and took them away, saying he would give half back when they blossomed. When the flowers bloomed, he only found one. The boy then said, "Now give it to me, and when you get more, you can take half."

He took the flower home, broke it, and Belmanti Rani emerged from inside. The maid collected her jewels and dressed her up, and the boy married Belmanti Rani. In this way, despite facing many difficulties, he fulfilled what was mentioned earlier. A person should always strive to accomplish their tasks like this.
