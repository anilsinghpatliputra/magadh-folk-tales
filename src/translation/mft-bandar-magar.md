Once upon a time, there was a king. Every night, he roamed around his kingdom. One time, he stopped at the door of a poor man named Latif Miyan. Latif had a daughter and a wife, but the daughters had gone out with someone else. That night, Latif was talking to his wife, saying, "Those who have wealth either bury it in the ground or invest it in education! When the girl grows up, she is sent off with her husband!" The king overheard this and returned to his palace.

The king called for a soldier on an elephant. As he arrived, the soldier fell at the king's feet, and the king said, "There is no need to be afraid. I will answer whatever you ask!" The king asked, "What were you talking about at midnight? Speak the truth!" Latif replied, "I wasn't saying anything. I have a daughter who has run away with someone else after doing something wrong. Guests keep coming, but they are sent back. This is what I was talking about, nothing else, Your Majesty! And one more thing: 'Invest your wealth to educate and teach. The grown-up girl should go to her own home!'" After hearing this, the king granted Latif five bighas of land and sent him back home on the elephant. Latif was happy and began to live comfortably in his new estate.

The king took three thousand rupees and went out somewhere. After going a little distance, he buried one thousand rupees under a peepal tree. From there, he went to a tax collector's place and gave him another one thousand rupees, saying that he should return it when he needed it. The king then moved on. Upon reaching the police station, he asked an officer, "Will I get any job?" The officer gave him a position as a constable, and the king was pleased with his work. One day, the officer told the new constable, "You will come with me for the night patrol!" The two set out on their patrol at midnight. On their way, they reached the king's court. The officer seated the constable and then went inside the palace. After a while, he came out and told the constable, "I left my handkerchief on the bed, go bring it!" The constable brought the handkerchief from the bed and handed it to the officer, and both returned to the station. The officer asked a woman, "Hey lady, was your guest here last night?"

The king's daughter told her father that she would not live until the new constable was beheaded. The king wrote a letter to the officer. The officer sent the new constable to the forest with four executioners to be hanged. The new constable said, "For my head, I have a hundred rupees, so please let me go!" The executioner replied, "Alright, give me the one thousand rupees, and I'll take you back with a pig's heart!" The new constable and the executioner went to the tax collector and said, "Please give me one thousand rupees." The tax collector replied, "Where will you give me the money? I don't recognize you!" The tax collector refused to give the money. Agreeing with the executioner, the new constable went back to the peepal tree where he had buried the money. He took out one thousand rupees from there and gave it to the executioner, who then let him go. The constable went back and gave the pig's heart to the queen. The king returned to his palace.

The king wrote a letter to his in-laws that "My wife is in the royal kitchen, and the officer and tax collector have also come." The king then went to his kitchen. There, a ceremony took place, and everyone returned, leaving them outside the village. First, the king dropped the tax collector into a well and asked, "Do you recognize me?" The tax collector said, "I have beaten you five times. I well know you, who else would have gone down with a rumor?" The king pulled him out of the well. After that, he dropped the tax collector into the well. The king asked the tax collector, "Do you recognize me? Have we met somewhere?" The tax collector replied, "I do not know you! We have not met!" The king pulled the tax collector out. After that, the officer was also thrown into the well. The king asked the officer, "Do you recognize me?" The officer replied, "I do not know you!" This continued for the queen, who was also thrown in. The queen was asked the same question: "Have we met anywhere? Do you recognize me?" The queen replied, "I have not met you. I do not recognize you!" She was then left in the well. Five pots were dropped into the well and filled with the water. The king granted the old woman twelve bighas of land. She began to live comfortably.

Finally, the king called Latif Miyan and gave him one thousand rupees and said, "I have received all your words. They turned out to be true." Latif began to live comfortably and enjoy his life.
