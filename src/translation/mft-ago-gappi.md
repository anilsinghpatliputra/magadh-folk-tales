There was a talkative person. He was famous for his gossiping. One day, he went for a walk in the market. He sat at a sweet shop there, and the shopkeeper said, "Hey, talkative brother, share a gossip!" The talkative guy replied, "What kind of gossip? Haven't you seen that your wife just left with someone?!" Hearing this, the sweet shopkeeper ran away. Meanwhile, his wife had just come out of the house and asked where he went. The talkative guy said, "Your wife just left with someone!"

Upon hearing this, he got angry and ran away. Both a husband and wife were looking for each other in the street. While searching, they met in between, with the wife carrying a stick and the husband with a weapon. The husband asked, "Did I not tell you that another gathering has arrived?" The wife replied, "My talkative friend told me that another gathering has gone with him!" Then the husband said, "Come on, we've fallen into the trap today. Now that we've both gotten into such a mess, let's get into the river!" They both jumped into the river.

Meanwhile, the talkative guy reached "Sarwa" (a common term used) and found no one at home. He asked the talkative friend sitting there where his sister-in-law had gone. The talkative guy replied, "Hey, sir! Didn’t your sister also have a child?" He said yes. Then the talkative guy remarked, "Well, that one has died. So they both have gone to bury him! Is there anybody in the village? No one seems to be around, sir!" Hearing this, 'Sarwa' ran to the riverbank and reached the place of the dead. The two who had been washing themselves started to cry loudly seeing 'Sarwa'. When they got closer, the sister-in-law asked, "Why are you crying, brother?" 'Sarwa' replied, "Someone said that your child has died!" Hearing this, they said, "We too have gotten into that!” Then, he went back to inquire from the gossiping friend, "Why did you say something like that to us?" The talkative guy answered, "But did you not say it first? I just echoed your gossip; the rest is up to you!"
