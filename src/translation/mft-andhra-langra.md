Once, there was a blind man and a lame man. One day, they decided that instead of sitting idle, they would go out to earn something. So they took a drum and set off. While they were walking, it became dark. The blind man asked the lame man how long it had been. The lame man replied that it was evening now. The blind man then asked if there was a tiger's den nearby. The lame man confirmed that there was indeed a tiger's den. They both sat down in it and started to play the drum. Hearing the drum in his den, the tiger came out and asked who they were. The blind man asked the tiger who he was. The tiger replied that he was the king of the jungle! The blind man boasted that he was one and a quarter times that size! Hearing this, the tiger ran away in fear.

Seeing the tiger running away, the lion asked him where he was fleeing to, uncle tiger. The tiger replied that there was a blind man and a lame man in his den. The lion said that they were not a lion! They were both the blind man and the lame man! Then he suggested that they go and check. The tiger said he wouldn’t go; he would tie both of his legs. Tying his legs, he went, and the blind man asked the lame man what the tiger was doing. The lame man replied that the tiger was coming along with the lion. The blind man said to let him come. When the tiger arrived, the blind man instructed the lame man to catch the tiger instead of the lion. Upon hearing this, the tiger ran away. While escaping, the lion got dragged and died, and then the tiger fled from there.

While running, the tiger reached a hill. There, all the other tigers were having a council. He approached them and said, "Dear friends, there’s a blind man and a lame man in my den." The tigers said, "Let's go!" They all went there, and the blind man asked the lame man what the tiger was doing. The lame man responded that yes, now a hundred tigers were coming. The blind man asked if he could see a palm tree. The lame man confirmed that there was indeed a palm tree. They both climbed it. When all the tigers arrived, they noticed that the two weren’t there. Then one tiger said that they must be on the palm tree.

All the tigers started climbing the palm tree, and there was still one hand's reach remaining to catch the two. The blind man said to let go of all the tigers and catch the one at the bottom. As soon as the bottom tiger heard this, he quickly escaped. After that, all the tigers fell down from above and died. Then the blind man and the lame man descended from the palm tree and took all the gold and silver from the tiger's den and returned home.
