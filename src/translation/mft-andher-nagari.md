In a city called Hurhuhangpur, vegetables and snacks were sold at the same price. The king had decreed that everything should be sold for the same price. One day, a saint came to the kingdom with his clever disciple. The disciple, seeing the customs and practices there, remarked that this place was not worth living! The saint asked, "Why?" The disciple replied, "A merchant took six melons to the market to sell, but they did not sell. He went to the king to collect his dues. He would not receive less than seven pieces. The king asked him why he brought six melons. As a result, he lost even the six melons he had brought. When he went for justice, the king challenged him, asking why he brought only six to sell. Grab him!" Saying this, the disciple expressed, "Baba, I will not stay here!" The saint replied, "Here, everything is available cheaply. We should not leave here!" But the disciple was unwilling. He left for another place and said, "Call me if needed!"

Days went by. After a few days, a wealthy merchant was caught stealing, and the thief was killed by the ground, upon which the town was abuzz that the merchant had been robbed. A woman saw the thief covered in dirt, and he turned out to be her husband. She filed a complaint with the king, stating, "My husband was stealing and was killed by the ground, what am I supposed to eat?" The royal guards were dispatched, and they captured the merchant. When taken to the king's court, the king asked him why he built such a house that became a grave for the thief. Who will take care of his children now?" The merchant replied, "What is my fault in this? This is the fault of the earth-mover; it was his mistake that the earth collapsed at a time when my husband was sneaking in!" Laborers who built the house were called. They said, "Sir, we are not to blame. It was the fault of the earth-mover, who did not move the earth properly!" The earth-mover was brought in and he said, "Sir, I have no fault. At that time, a woman passed by, upon whom I was distracted, and because of that, I could not handle the earth properly!"

Then the king issued another order, and the woman was brought in. She said, "I am not at fault in this, Your Excellency! I was merely visiting a friend!" In response, the friend was captured and brought to the king's court. The king ordered that she be hanged. A thin and frail man was brought forth, whose neck wouldn’t fit the noose. The hanging officer told the king, "Your Majesty, he is so thin that his neck will not fit the rope!" To this, the king replied, "Bring a heavier man to hang him!" The guards captured a robust old man and brought him. He requested a day's time. The king told him to come the next day.

The old man went to his disciple and narrated the situation. The disciple suggested, "Let's go, I have a plan. We will go to the king and say, 'Hang us, hang us!' " Following this suggestion, they went to the king's presence and began to push and shove each other, shouting, "I want to be hanged first, no, I want to be hanged first!" Witnessing this scene, the king summoned both and inquired what was going on. The disciple said, "This moment is so significant, that whoever gets hanged at this time will be the king of all seven islands!" Hearing this, the king joyfully decided to hang himself.
