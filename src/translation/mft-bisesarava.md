Once upon a time, there was a Brahmin named Bisesarwa. He was unmarried. One day, he went to a fortune teller and asked, "Who will I marry?" The fortune teller replied that there was a washerman in his village, and he would marry his daughter. Upon hearing this, Bisesarwa kicked the fortune teller and said, "I am a priest, and I will not marry a washerman's daughter." Saying this, he returned to his village.

Meanwhile, the priest devised a clever plan to take revenge. One day, the washerman went out to wash clothes with his daughter. The priest set fire to the washerman's house and ran to inform the washerman. Leaving his daughter behind, the washerman rushed to extinguish the fire. In his absence, the priest tore the girl's clothes and threw her into the river. As she was floating down, a Brahmin saw her and took her in. This Brahmin had no offspring, so he raised the girl very well, and when she grew up, he went out to seek a groom for her.

By chance, he reached Bisesarwa, and he agreed to the marriage. The wedding was beautifully arranged, and all were invited. The fortune teller was also invited, and he attended as well. The wedding was quite splendid. After the wedding, Bisesarwa kicked the fortune teller again and said, "Look, you said I would marry a washerman's daughter, but see, I have married a Brahmin girl!" The fortune teller replied, "You can beat me or do anything, but she is the one." If you don't believe me, just lift her dress a bit and check if there’s a scar." When Bisesarwa looked, indeed there was a scar.

Embarrassed, he sought forgiveness from the fortune teller and brought the washerman's daughter home. Leaving her at home, he went to the forest. In the forest, after wandering around, he ended up resting under a large banyan tree.

In the house, the woman began to feel her time of the month, and at that moment, Bisesarwa’s body began to weaken. He was unable to sit or stand. There were two birds on the banyan tree, a male and a female, and they were conversing. The male said, "You can't trust women," to which the female replied, "You can't trust men." While they were talking, they started arguing, and the male asked, "Why can't you trust men?" The female responded, "Look, there’s a man under this tree who doesn’t trust women; see how he has become." He could not even move.

Then the male said, "How can this man's body be fixed?" The female replied, "If his wife was clever, he would be fine again." The male asked, "How?" The female said, "If the wife had saved her menstrual cloth and applied it to him, he would get better." Then the male asked, "How do we get him home?" The female replied, "We can both carry him on our wings and get him home."

In the middle of the night, the two birds helped him reach home. Bisesarwa listened to all their conversation. Upon reaching home, he unlocked the door and apologized to his wife, asking if she had saved her menstrual cloth. She replied, "Yes, I've saved them." Bisesarwa said, "If you wish to make me well again, then every day apply the cloth from your menstrual cycle to my body."

The wife began applying the cloth daily. He became well again, just like before.
