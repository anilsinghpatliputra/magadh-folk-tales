Once upon a time, there was a prince who had a great desire to wander around. The king's prime minister, an old man, had seen and heard a lot about the world. The advice he gave was precious, and each piece of it was invaluable.

One day, the prince decided he wanted to travel the world. He shared his thoughts with his father, the king, but the king didn’t want to let him out of his sight. Since the prince was determined, he sought advice from the prime minister. The prime minister said, "There is no harm in traveling to different places. Traveling expands one's experience. However, I will tell the prince three invaluable pieces of advice. If he keeps these three things in mind, he will never get into trouble!"

The prince asked, "What are those three invaluable pieces of advice?" The prime minister replied, "Listen, my son! Wherever you go, always stay alert. That is the first thing."

"When you sit anywhere, be sure to check the place before you sit down." That is the second piece of advice, and the third is, "Never separate your weapons from yourself. Keep them close so you can protect yourself quickly!"

The prince memorized all three precious pieces of advice and set off on his journey. He rode on his fastest horse. Along the way, three thieves spotted him and began to follow him. The thieves planned to rob the prince. According to the prime minister's first piece of advice, the prince was being vigilant. He rode his horse so fast that the three thieves fell far behind. By the time it became dusk, he reached near a dense forest and saw a large, nice house where he requested shelter for the night.

The people living in that house treated him with great respect and invited him in, asking him to sit on a bed. Just as the prince was about to sit down, he remembered the second piece of advice from the prime minister. Suddenly, he kicked the bed, and it broke apart. Beneath the bed was a well filled with sharp spears and swords. Anyone who fell into it would have no hope of survival.

The people living in the house were actually thieves. The prince realized their trick. He quickly drew his sword and dispatched them in no time. He acknowledged that the three pieces of advice from the prime minister were indeed invaluable. When he returned, he narrated the entire story to the king, who then praised the prime minister even more.
