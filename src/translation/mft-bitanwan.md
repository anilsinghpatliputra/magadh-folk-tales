Once there was a boy named Bitnava. He asked his mother, "O mother, give me a buffalo. I will take care of it." His mother gave him a buffalo. Bitnava began to graze it. One day, he left the buffalo to eat and went to the king's garden, where there were eggplant trees, and the buffalo ate from there. The king had the buffalo killed. Bitnava said, "O King, you killed my buffalo, so give me its skin." The king replied, "Take it away! What will I do with it?" Bitnava took the skin. 

He went to the garden where there was a tree, and thieves would come there to steal and divide their loot. Bitnava climbed the tree, and when the thieves came at night to divide the money, Bitnava fell on them from above with the skin. The thieves shouted, "Oh my God! There's a ghost on it! Run away, you fools!" So, they all fled. Bitnava then climbed down and went home with all the money, telling his mother that he had brought so much money. His house was filled with money. 

The king then asked Bitnava, "Where did you get so much money?" Bitnava replied, "I got it from here and there." The king got angry and set fire to his house. Bitnava said, "O King, you have set my house on fire, so give me the ashes." The king said, "What can I keep them for? Take them away!" So, Bitnava packed the ashes in a bag and went to sell them. On his way, he met a trader who was selling diamonds and jewels. The trader asked Bitnava what he was selling. Bitnava said, "I also sell diamonds, jewels, and very valuable things." The trader asked, "Where are you going?" Bitnava replied he was going to the station, and the trader said he was going there too, so Bitnava said, "Let's go together!" While traveling, it became night, and they both slept in a village. In the middle of the night, the trader took the bag full of ashes and ran away. In the morning, when Bitnava did not see his bag, he took the trader's bag and went home. When he got home, he told his mother, "Look, mother, I have a lot of diamonds and jewels." His house was filled with those items.

Seeing this, the king got suspicious and wondered where Bitnava had gotten so many things. Then he had him tied up and thrown into the river. Every day, an elephant came to drink water. That day, as it was drinking, Bitnava climbed onto it and its trunk burst. Bitnava managed to escape and climbed onto the elephant to go home. When the king saw this, he said, "Hey Bitnava, throw me into the river tied in my own bag as well!" So, Bitnava tied the king tightly and threw him into the river. Likewise, when the elephant came to drink water, the king ended up exploding his belly on the bank, and he died there. And thatâ€™s how the story ends; think about it in your mind!
