There was a Baba ji who was highly regarded by his patrons. He also kept three or four disciples at his home, who served him. Baba ji somehow managed to collect twelve ashrafis. Since it was quite troublesome for him to travel far to visit his patrons, he decided to buy a horse and sent one of his disciples to buy it with five ashrafis. He instructed the disciple to purchase a fast and strong horse.

The disciple searched and found a horse for four ashrafis and brought it home. As soon as Baba ji mounted the horse with the reins in hand, the horse threw him off with a "thud." The priest became quite angry with his disciple and sent him to bring the horse back. However, the original owner of the horse refused to take it back. All the disciples returned without the horse.

On the way, they encountered a field of pumpkins belonging to a landowner. There were many pumpkins growing there. Seeing the pumpkins, the disciples asked what they were. The landowner said those were horse eggs. Hearing this, the disciples thought it would be good to take one well-formed egg. They asked the landowner, "Oh landowner, give us a good, fast, and strong horse that comes from these eggs!" The landowner said that he would take the horse and one ashrafi as payment. The landowner gave them a nice and round pumpkin and told them to carry it carefully, so it doesn't break on the way.

The disciples carefully took it away. They encountered a jungle along the way, where they heard the roar of a tiger. Hearing this, they became so frightened that they dropped the pumpkin from their heads. A rabbit that had been hiding in the bushes of the garden got scared and started to run away. The disciples thought that the horse's offspring had come out of the egg and was running away. They all chased after it, but the rabbit couldn't be caught.

Everyone returned home feeling dejected. They told Baba ji, "Sir, we exchanged the horse for a good horse's egg, but what can we say? The egg broke on the way! And the horse's offspring was so fast that it ran away!" The priest asked if there was another horse's egg, then they should bring it as well. This time the priest went along with them. Upon reaching there, he got very angry at the landowner for giving them such an egg, which never even reached home and broke on the way. The landowner said, "This time, choose carefully, oh priest!" He picked a bigger pumpkin. The landowner took three ashrafis for it. The priest brought it home and kept it.

After two or four days, when he looked at the pumpkin, it had rotted, and there were thousands of tiny insects inside it. The priest realized that this too was a ruined horse's egg given by the landowner. It had small, insignificant offspring inside it. How could this be a horse? The priest went back to the landowner again and expressed his displeasure. The landowner calmed him down after some exchange of words. He then gave him another fine pumpkin, saying it would definitely hatch into good offspring. The priest took the egg and placed it in his hut.

In his hut, there were large rats. They chewed through the pumpkin and created a hollow space inside. One day, when the priest came into his hut from outside, a rat ran out from the pumpkin, and the priest thought that a horse offspring had escaped from the egg. He called all the disciples. Together, they were very surprised and somehow managed to catch the rat. They then took it outside and tried to put a bridle on it. The rat bit them several times. The priest said, "This is a strong horse!" Somehow, they managed to put a saddle on the rat, but it died in the process. Now what was the priest to do? There wasn't even one ashrafi left with him.

The priest dragged his feet and went to his patrons. He told them all that had happened. The patrons said, "Priest, is there any horse egg at all? You must be foolish to believe some Baba ji! Go, we don’t need a priest like you!" The priest returned to his hut with a heavy heart, feeling dejected and making a face full of disappointment.
