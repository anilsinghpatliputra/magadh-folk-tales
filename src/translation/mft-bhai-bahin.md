This is a story in a folk style. Here's the translation:

Once there was a king who had six sons and one daughter. The five sons were married, and the youngest son was still a bachelor. One day he went for a walk by the riverbank and brought home a wild flower bush. He told one of his sisters-in-law that whoever eats this wild flower, he would marry her. His sister-in-law asked, "Whose wild flower is this? I will eat it!" The sister-in-law then said, "Go ahead, eat it!" She ate the wild flower. When the youngest son saw that the flower was gone, he asked everyone where the flower had gone. They all said, "Mother has eaten it." Then the youngest son said, "If she's gone, then I will marry her!"

Then the sister climbed a palm tree. There was already a monkey and a parrot on the tree. The girl's mother called out to her from the palm tree, saying:
*"Come down, my daughter. Once you were my daughter, but now you are my daughter-in-law."*

Then the daughter replied from the palm tree:
*"How can I come down, mother? Once you were my mother, now I am my mother-in-law."*

Then the sister-in-law went and said:
*"Come down, sister-in-law. Once you were my sister-in-law, now you are my sister-in-law."*

Then the sister-in-law from above replied:
*"How can I come down, sister-in-law? Once you were my sister-in-law, now I am my sister-in-law."*

This continued with the sister-in-law and brother talking back and forth, but the younger sister did not come down from the palm tree. Eventually, they all gave up and went back. One day, a great procession passed by that palm tree. Then the parrot called out from above, "Elder siblings, let's take a look!" The monkey also jumped down to see, and after this, the girls jumped as well, and there, she lost her life.
