Once upon a time, there was a king who had four sons. After some time, the king passed away. The four brothers pondered over who should get what and how to divide their inheritance. They decided to check the treasure. When they looked at an old document, they found that their father had written, "Four sons and three shares!" The brothers exclaimed, "Hey brother! This won't work; no one should give up their share, and it clearly states 'four sons and three shares.' So, let’s go find someone to decide for us!"

The four brothers went to a moneylender to seek justice. They shared their entire story with him. The moneylender said, "If I am to provide justice for all, I will also do so for you! But wait, let's eat first, and then we can discuss justice!" He told his wife, "Prepare a nice meal. When the prince's sons sit to eat, they will speak up and ask for their share, especially when they are eating a lavish meal, and if they don’t listen or take the hint, then we’ll question them one by one!"

When it was time to eat, his wife said, "Sir, we have only one plate, so take small bites as you go!" The eldest brother started to eat, and just as he took a bite, the wife asked him, "Sir, will you take a bite of rice while telling us an untold story or recount an unheard tale?" After hearing this, he thought that this was too much. How could there be an untold story or an unheard tale? It was better not to eat. He got up without eating. Similarly, the middle and younger brothers faced the same situation and left without eating.

Finally, the youngest brother arrived, and when his wife asked him the same question, he realized that all his brothers had been asked the same thing, and they had left without eating too. "I can recount an untold story or speak of an unheard tale. Today I saw that the moneylender was sitting at the shop, and a beautiful girl came along. The moneylender flirted with her, and they both have gone to the river together!" After hearing this, the wife was furious. She took a stick and said, "Today, I will deal with that troublemaker!"

The wife ran angrily toward the river and told the moneylender, "Hey moneylender, I am ashamed to tell you this, but the wife of the moneylender fed me. A young man with a beautiful moustache came here, and he was flirting with her. Both of them have gone to the river!" Upon hearing this, the moneylender was filled with rage and said, "That woman has brought disgrace to me today!" He took a stick and went searching for her by the river.

There, the moneylender was swinging a stick from one side while the wife was reciprocating. The moneylender shouted, "You have become a whore, and today I will teach you a lesson!" The wife replied, "You think you can beat me? I will show you what I'm made of! Is there anyone better than me?" When they finally met, they were both filled with shame. The moneylender then commanded, "Now let's go home!" They had agreed to tell a story, and that was the situation.

Now, listen further! The four brothers told the moneylender, "Hey moneylender, you haven't provided us justice!" The moneylender replied, "I will do it right away!" He was an old man who had known their father. He created a statue of their father and called the eldest son, saying, "This statue is of your father. If you urinate on it, I will give you your share!" The prince replied, "Oh moneylender, whether you give me my share or not, I cannot urinate on my father's face!" Likewise, the middle and youngest brothers were asked, but they also refused.

Finally, the moneylender called the youngest brother and said the same thing. He thought to himself, "What harm could it do? I will get my share!" So he urinated on the statue. The moneylender then called all four brothers and said, "Hey brothers, justice has been served! The reason the youngest brother is clever is that he didn't even recognize his own father and urinated on his face! Your father was very wise, and he wrote correctly that 'four sons and three shares!' So you three can share among yourselves, and do not give any part to the youngest!" The brothers left feeling baffled—ponder over your hearts!
