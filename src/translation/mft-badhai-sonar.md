Once there were two close friends, a goldsmith and a woodworker. They lived together and one day they decided that they should go out and find jobs. With this thought, both friends set off for a foreign land. After traveling a short distance, they stopped in a village and decided that they should make money and keep it in one place. The woodworker started working on his craft while the goldsmith began trading in gold. In this way, both of them amassed a good amount of money. After some days, the friends returned home and said that they should divide the money they had earned. When they got home, they started dividing the money. The goldsmith said that he would take two shares, but the woodworker insisted on splitting it equally. This led to a quarrel between them.

The argument reached the king, who was informed of the matter. The king said that he would make a decision immediately and instructed both to show their work. The goldsmith then requested the king to create a large pond and give him six measures of gold. Immediately, the pond was dug and the goldsmith received the gold. The goldsmith crafted a beautiful boat and set it afloat in the pond. The boat navigated all over the pond, and everyone watching was delighted.

Now, the king asked the woodworker to showcase his skills. The woodworker asked for a piece of wood, which was immediately provided. He then crafted an excellent horse and stated that no person would be able to ride it. The king declared that whoever would ride the horse would get half of his kingdom. No one dared to ride it, until finally, the king's son volunteered. As soon as he mounted the horse, it sprang into the air but did not stop. The king's son flew far away. Eventually, the spring mechanism on the horse slowed down, and it landed in a city. The king's daughter saw him and was enamored, ready to marry him.

The prince married, enjoying life there. After a year, his wife became pregnant. He arranged a journey back home. On the way, his wife asked him to bring the horse down as she was feeling unwell. The prince saw that there was nothing around, just water, with no land in sight. Spotting a small hill, he landed the horse there, and the queen gave birth to a boy. The king's son then rode off to call the villagers for news. He dismounted the horse outside the village and went into his own village. Meanwhile, a shepherd began to graze his horse. When the king's son returned, he found the horse missing. The villagers returned, and he started working under a farmer.

In time, his wife somehow raised their child. One day, a merchant who had been trading by the sea returned home and saw the beautiful child and his mother. He decided to marry the mother and took her home. After a few days, he told her, "I am going on a pilgrimage; give me some money, and you keep the child." A fisherman then boarded his boat, and off they went. They anchored their boat at the shore where the horse had been left. He went into the village and announced that he would marry whoever claimed the wooden horse. No one in the village knew about the wooden horse, so nobody came forward. But when her first husband heard this, he revealed the story of the wooden horse. After that, the woman boarded the boat with her real husband and went home to her merchant.

They both stayed there for some days, and then the merchant’s wife said that it was time for her to return to her homeland as she had met her husband. The prince returned home with his wife and child. They reached home in two to four days. Upon their arrival, the king was very happy. The prince recounted the entire story of their adventures. Then the king announced a decision for the woodworker and the goldsmith, saying, "Both did well! Let them divide the money equally!" They shared the money and went home.
