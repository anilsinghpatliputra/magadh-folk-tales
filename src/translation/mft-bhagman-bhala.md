Once there was a king, and he had a minister. There was a deep affection between the two, and they could not live without each other. The minister had a saying: "Whatever God does, does it for the best." Whenever something happened, he always said this. When good things happened, this saying might appear good to anyone, but when bad things happened, saying such things might even seem wrong.

One day, while the king was sharpening his sword, he ran his finger along the edge to check its sharpness, and he accidentally cut his finger, causing blood to flow profusely. Upon receiving the news, the royal physician hurried over and, using his knowledge and medicine, stopped the bleeding and rejoined the finger, binding it with a cloth.

The king felt very sorry, pondering how unfortunate it was that he had been testing the sword's sharp edge at that moment. The minister, standing beside him, heard the king's lament and, as per his habit, spoke, "Whatever God does, does it for the best." 

Hearing this, the king became very angry. He thought, "I've cut my finger, there is so much blood, and I'm in so much pain, and this minister has the audacity to say, 'Whatever God does, does it for the best.'" So the king dismissed the minister from his kingdom. Even as he was leaving, the minister said again, "Whatever God does, does it for the best."

Feeling disheartened alone, the king went out to hunt to divert his mind, and he ventured into a dense forest. There, fierce wild tribes captured him, preparing to sacrifice him to their goddess. Just then, their leader noticed his severed finger and shouted, "This man is not fit to be sacrificed. He is blemished!"

The tribesmen not only released the king but also showed him the way out of the forest. Upon returning to his palace, the concerned queen was relieved to see him. The king narrated all the events to her. Now, the king began to appreciate the minister's words. He was eager to meet him. Men were sent running in all directions, and finally, they found the minister. The king took back the punishment he had given to the minister and rewarded him with a lot of wealth. However, he couldn't help but ask, "I survived having my finger cut off, but what benefit did you gain?" The minister laughed and replied, "Provider of food! If you had not dismissed me from your kingdom, I would have surely accompanied you on the hunt, and those tribesmen would have definitely sacrificed me, as my finger was not cut!"
