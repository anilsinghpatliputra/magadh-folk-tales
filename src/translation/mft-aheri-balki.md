Once upon a time, there was a very wealthy king. His treasury was filled with riches, but he did not have a single son. Because of this, he was very sad. Whenever someone looked at him in the morning, they would say, "Today, it seems, we are witnessing the face of sorrow." The king, knowing this, would silently endure. One day, while he was sleeping in his chamber, a ray of light broke in. Hearing the sound of the servant cleaning outside, the king woke up. When he opened the door, the servant remarked, "Today, I see the face of sorrow; how is the day passing?" Hearing this, the king felt embarrassed and closed the door, taking a vow that he would not open the door until someone could understand his grief. Thus, he remained locked up in his chamber, hungry and thirsty.

One day, in the middle of the night, the throne of Brahma shook, awakening him. He said to open the door. The king replied from inside, "As long as no one understands my sorrow, I will not open the door." After three vows were made, Brahma spoke, "I will understand your sorrow." Hearing this, the king opened the door. Brahma explained that there is a forest with a temple. "Go there and perform worship. When you meditate, a golden bird will come and sit on your arm. If you catch it, you will swallow it."

Listening to this, the king got up and went to that forest. He entered the temple, performed worship, and meditated. Then a bird came and sat on his arm, but he was so engrossed in meditation that he did not catch the bird, and it flew away. When the king's meditation broke, he began to weep loudly. Hearing his cries, Brahma, disguised as a sage, returned and said, "This time, you must act differently; if you do not catch the bird, you will have no children."

The king prayed again and meditated, and this time the golden bird sat on his arm. The king quickly caught it and swallowed it. Brahma had already warned him that he would not see his child until twelve years had passed, and the child would not come out until then. The king brought the child back to the palace and the queen gave birth after nine months. Preparations were made in the palace for the queen and the child. The child was as radiant as the moon. Eleven years passed, and the child insisted on going hunting. If he was not allowed to go, he threatened to kill himself with a sword. The queen, feeling helpless, gave permission. A large army was armed and sent with the child.

While hunting, the king's son ended up in a dense jungle where it became night. He set up camp by a waterhole. The soldiers kept watch while the boy slept in between. At that moment, two celestial maidens were flying in the sky. Seeing the boy, they said he should be married to such a charming boy. Meanwhile, a king from across seven seas noticed such a beautiful girl who was as radiant as the moon. They lifted the boy in his cot and carried him away, placing him next to the girl who was sleeping in her palace quarters.

When the girl woke up, she saw a boy sleeping beside her. Enchanted by his appearance, she fell for him. The celestial maidens flapped their wings vigorously to create a breeze, causing the girl to doze off again, but the boy awoke and found a girl sleeping next to him in the palace. Captivated by her beauty, he fell for her as well. At that moment, the maidens once again created a breeze, causing the girl to wake up again. They both thought, "Are we dreaming?" The girl then asked the boy, "Where is your home?" The boy shared his story, and she told hers. In no time, they fell in love and exchanged rings. In the meantime, the celestial maidens flapped their wings vigorously, causing both of them to fall asleep again.

Later, the maidens swapped their cots and brought the prince back to the same jungle, placing his cot where the soldiers were keeping guard. In the morning, when the boy woke up and did not see the girl, he cried, "Alas, my beloved!" Seeing this, the soldiers remarked that the boy had gone mad. But then they noticed that the cot was different and that the rings were swapped. The boy said that when he married, it would be to that same beloved.

When the girl woke up and did not see the boy, she cried out, "Alas, my beloved!" Everyone noticed and said that the girl had gone insane. However, upon closer inspection, they realized that the cot was different and that the ring was also different. Then the girl said that when she married, it would be to the beloved prince.

Both parties, the prince and the maiden, sent out a messenger to find out where the beloved prince and the beautiful maiden were from. If they could find out, they would unite them in marriage. Exhausted and thirsty from their search, the messengers met at one location. When they inquired among themselves, they learned the whole story. Everyone rejoiced, and a celebration was held there. At the appointed time, the boy and the girl got married. The boy brought the girl home, and they lived happily, ruling the kingdom together.
