Once there was a king. He had a small bird in his house. One day, the bird found a spotted seashell while flying outside. Then it came back home and started chirping, "The king has no wealth, just as much wealth I have!" While it was talking like this, the king caught it and snatched away its seashell. Then the bird went and started chirping, "The king has become poor, he took away my wealth." The king felt pity and gave it back the seashell.

Then the bird began to fly around and chirped, "The king has become afraid, he has given me my wealth!" The king became very irritated. He caught the bird and was about to pull out its feathers when it started to sing, "You have come to pluck and dance, oh mother!" When the bird started to plead, it said, "You have come to nibble, oh mother!" Then when it was put in a pot, it said, "You have come to boil, oh mother!" As the bird began to get cooked in the pot, it said, "You have come to tear and shred, oh mother!" When the king was about to eat it, the bird said, "You have come to chew, oh mother!" When the morning came, the king felt dizzy! At that moment, the bird chirped, "You have come to see the light, oh mother!" After that, the bird flew away!
