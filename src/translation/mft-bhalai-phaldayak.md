Once, there was a Baba who was very poor. One day, he went to the field in the morning. While digging, he found a pot that was stuck in the ground containing water. Inside the pot, there was already a tiger, a snake, and a golden man (goldsmith). They pleaded with him to let them out. Baba thought that if he released the tiger, it would eat him, and if he freed the snake, it would bite him. But he could let the goldsmith out because he was a human. However, how could he get the goldsmith out? The tiger wouldn’t allow him. The priest released the tiger first. After that, he let the snake out, and then finally the goldsmith. The tiger fell at Baba's feet and said, "You are my guru. One day, I will come to you." The snake also accepted him as his guru and requested him to come to visit. The goldsmith said the same. Then the priest returned home.

A few days later, the priest went to the tiger, and he found many tigers in the forest. All the tigers pounced on him wanting to eat him. The priest said, "This is my disciple, the tiger." Hearing this, all the tigers accepted him as a disciple. He stayed there for two to four days. Then he said, "Now I will return home, disciple!" The tiger-disciple offered him a considerable amount of gold and silver as a gift. As Baba left, he thought about whether he could also visit the snake disciple.

He then went to the snake's den. As he was going forward, he met the disciple. The disciple bowed down to him and took him to his place. He stayed there for two to four days. Then he said, "Snake-disciple, now I will go home." Upon hearing this, the snake’s disciple came back and said, "This is what is appropriate for a poor person like me." The snake said, "There is a power in the snake that whenever a calamity strikes you, you should call out to the truth with a voice saying, 'Oh, true snake, help me!'" Baba blessed the disciple and departed. On the way, he thought about how respected he was by the tiger and the snake. "Let’s see how respected I am by the goldsmith disciple!"

From there, Baba reached the goldsmith's place. When he arrived, he was asked, "Who is making such a ruckus?" Baba replied, "Oh, my host, don’t be upset. Just look at my belongings. I will return shortly!" Baba placed his belongings and went out. By then, the goldsmith had opened his belongings to see. On that very day, a robbery had occurred in the kingdom, and the things in Baba's belongings belonged to the king. The goldsmith immediately bound them and took them to the king. The king inquired, "Where has Baba gone?" The goldsmith replied, "He has returned." When Baba reached the goldsmith's place, the king asked, "Where did you find all this?" Baba replied, "The tiger and snake disciples gave them to me." The king scolded him and took him away, saying, "Did the tiger and the snake give you all this wealth?" They imprisoned him in a dungeon.

An order was given to hang the prisoner. The prisoner began to smoke ganja, and Baba also asked him to let him take a puff. After all, they were both going to be killed. One of the prisoners said, "Go on, give me a puff! Then I will die." Baba got a chillum (a smoking pipe) and showed the power of the snake, saying, "Oh, true snake, help me!" The snake heard this and hurriedly came. Baba explained everything. The snake said, "I will go and bite the king's only son, and he will die. You go and say that I too am chanting the mantra." Then the snake left and bit the king's son. The king's son died. There was chaos all around.

From the dungeon, Baba called out, "What’s all this commotion?" Upon hearing this, people said, "The snake has bitten the king's son." Baba replied, "I will also chant a mantra!" When this news reached the king, he quickly summoned Baba. Baba went there and said, "Quickly, bring some milk!" The king ordered for milk to be fetched, and it was prepared. Baba mixed the milk with a spell and closed the lid. The snake descended and drank the milk, and also revived the king's son. The king's son came back to life. The snake returned to the forest. The king, overjoyed at his son’s revival, presented all the wealth initially given to Baba and also doubled it as a farewell gift. Baba returned home happily. He reaped the rewards of his service. The tale concluded in the forest; understand it in your heart!
