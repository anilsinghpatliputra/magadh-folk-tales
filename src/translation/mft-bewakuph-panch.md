Once, a baba (an elderly man) went to prepare a feast for his in-laws. After finishing the feast, he set out with his wife, and on the way, they came across a river with low water. The bearers crossed the river, and Baba ji, along with his wife, started to cross after having something to eat. Baba ji thought that since there were just two of them, they would easily cross the river. When they began to cross, Baba ji lifted up his clothes. There was a pig nearby that was watching them. The pig noticed a mark on the right thigh of Baba ji's wife and also crossed the river. The pig said to Baba ji, "This is my wife." Baba ji replied, "No, she is mine."

Both of them quarreled and went to a panch (local judge) for a decision. The panch gathered together and asked Baba ji to identify his wife. Baba ji responded, "I will tell you; I just finished the feast!" The panch then asked the pig, "What is a special mark on your wife?" The pig replied, "My wife has a birthmark on her right thigh." After hearing this, the panch summoned a midwife to check the mark. The midwife went and, in private, examined the pig's wife's right thigh and affirmed that she indeed had a birthmark there. The panch then declared that she indeed belonged to the pig.

Later, all three of them were locked in separate rooms, and they all began to cry. Hearing their cries, the panch asked Baba ji why he was crying. He said, "I am crying because my wife is with the pig." When the panch asked the pig why he was crying, he responded that his male counterpart, Baba ji, had met the pig. Then the panch inquired about the pig's reason for crying, to which the pig replied, "I am crying for justice. Does the pig have a husband somewhere?"
