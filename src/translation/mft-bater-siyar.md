Once there was a quail, and there was also a jackal. Both were very good friends. One day, the jackal said, "Hey buddy, I feel like eating curd." The quail responded, "Sure! Let's go one day to buy some curd from the villagers." So, the quail went to sit on the next ridge. The jackal looked back and called out, "Friend quail! Friend quail! Friend quail! Quail ho!" Then all the villagers started trying to catch the quail. By the time the jackal arrived, everyone had eaten the curd and had run away after defecating in the pot. When they came back, they saw and said, "Oh friend, everything is in a mess now! What do we do?" So they decided to leave.

The next day, the jackal said to the quail, "Hey buddy, I feel like laughing!" The quail replied, "Sure, brother! One day a soldier was tying a red turban and walking with two or three guards, carrying sticks. The soldier was walking ahead and the guards were following behind. The quail flew and sat on the soldier's head. The guards saw and shouted "Quail-quail!" and hit the soldier on the head with a stick. The soldier's head got hurt. Then the jackal started to laugh so hard that his stomach hurt. The soldier ran away.

The next day the jackal said to the quail, "Hey buddy, now I feel like eating!" The quail replied, "Sure! You should stay a little behind me." The jackal did as told. One day, the quail went to a place where there was a pack of eight or ten dogs. The quail flew there, and the jackal followed behind. Now, the dogs attacked the jackal fiercely, biting and tearing it apart. When the jackal returned, he met the quail and said, "Buddy, you almost got me killed!" The quail retorted, "But you told me you wanted to eat, so how could I help you! Now it's your turn to be careful!"
