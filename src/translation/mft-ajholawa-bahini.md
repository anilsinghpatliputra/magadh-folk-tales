Once there was a king who had seven sons and one daughter. The seven brothers, after completing their education, started going for jobs. They told their sister that if anyone troubles you, let us know everything. After explaining this, all the brothers went abroad. The younger sister asked for food, and the youngest sister-in-law responded, "Oh, just give it like that! If you bring the black blanket clean and white, then it may be received, or may not!" Taking the blanket, the younger sister went into the garden and started crying, saying, "All seven brothers have gone abroad, and all six sisters-in-law have troubled me." Hearing her cry, all the birds in the garden came down and asked, "Why are you crying, younger sister?" She replied, "Sisters-in-law told me to clean the black blanket, without soap or detergent!" So the birds all relieved themselves on the blanket, and it became clean.

The younger sister took the blanket and said, "Now don’t say you won’t give me food; it is now clean." The sister-in-law said, "Oh please! Will food be given just like that? Unless you bring the wrinkles without a sickle or a hoe and have them removed, you won’t get food!" The younger sister went back to the garden and cried again, "Oh brothers have gone abroad, and six sisters-in-law have caused me great sorrow! How can I remove the wrinkles, oh Ram!" Upon hearing this, all the birds fell down from the trees and shook off the wrinkles. The younger sister took the wrinkles home and said, "Now here is the food." The sisters-in-law again remarked, "Oh please! Will you give food now? Unless you bring one hundred maunds of rice without pounding it, you won't get food!"

The younger sister went back into the garden and cried again, "All seven brothers have gone abroad, and sisters-in-law have caused me much pain, oh Ram!" Hearing this, all the birds came down from the trees and asked if she hadn’t been given food yet. The younger sister replied, "Where is it given? They told me to pound one hundred maunds of rice without a mortar and pestle." The birds said, "Alright, break open the rice!" She opened the rice. The birds quickly pecked at the rice. Among them, a black bird took a little bit. When the younger sister weighed the rice, a little less came out. The younger sister then declared that until the little bit was brought back, she wouldn’t get any food. 

The younger sister returned to the garden and cried out, "Which birds have stolen a little from me, oh Ram!" All the birds gathered and saw that the black bird had filled itself, so they all pitched in to catch it and took out the bit from its beak and gave it back to the younger sister.

Taking the bit with her, she returned home and asked for food. The sisters-in-law still didn’t give her food. Then she said, "Bring water without a pot or string!" The younger sister went to them and cried, "All seven brothers have gone away, and sisters-in-law are making me suffer; how can I fill water, oh Ram!" Hearing her crying, they brought water above. After filling the water, she took it home. Behind her, all her seven brothers were coming on horses. The younger sister reached home first, and right after her, the brothers arrived. Seeing their sister in distress, all in-laws were asked why they troubled her. No one spoke up, so they asked the younger sister what troubles she faced. The sister replied that all the sisters-in-law would have fed her, but the youngest sister-in-law didn’t give her any. Hearing this, all seven brothers filled her up with food and started staying with their sister.
