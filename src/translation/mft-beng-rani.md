Once, there was a parrot. It gathered wheat, dried it, and made a liter of litti. When it started eating the litti, a frog jumped in. Seeing the frog, the parrot said, "Frog queen, frog queen, would you like some litti?" The frog replied, "If you give, I will eat; if not, I will just watch!" The parrot gave it a litti and asked, "Would you like more?" This way, the parrot kept giving, and the frog kept eating the litti. In the end, the frog ate the parrot as well. 

As it moved ahead, it met a goat herder. The frog asked, "Goat herder brother! Will you give me goat's milk?" The herder replied, "Get lost or I'll kick you out! You think a goat would give milk to a frog?" The frog said, "I ate a liter of sweet litti; if the parrot ate such sweet food, would it take long for you to feed me?" Saying this, the frog ate the herder along with the goat. 

As it moved further, it encountered a cow herder and asked, "Cow herder brother! Will you give me cow's milk?" The herder replied, "Get lost or I'll kick you out! You think a human would give milk to a frog?" The frog, in reply, said, "I ate a liter of sweet litti; I ate the goat herder, so would it take long for you to feed me?" Saying this, the frog ate the cow along with the herder.

After that, it also ate the buffalo herder and the king's servant, and while walking on the road, it met a bridegroom. Seeing the groom's palanquin, the frog said, "Hey groom's brother! Will you let me ride in the palanquin too?" The groom replied, "Get lost or you'll burst your stomach!" The frog said, "I ate a liter of sweet litti; I ate the parrot, the goat herder, the cow herder, the buffalo herder, and the king's servant, so would it take long for you to feed me?" After saying this, it devoured the whole wedding party along with the groom's palanquin. 

After all this eating, the frog felt heavy and fell on the road. A passing elephant approached. The elephant said, "Move aside, or you will burst your stomach!" But the frog did not budge. The elephant climbed onto the frog's back, and its stomach burst. The parrot flew away with the litti, the goat herder took the goat home, and the cow and buffalo herders took their cattle home. The king's servant took the water to the royal court. All the people from the wedding party also left with the groom's palanquin. The frog died there from bursting. This is what happens due to excessive greed! Too much greed leads to bursting!
