Once, the emperor asked Birbal, "Will you do whatever I say?" Birbal replied, "I will!" The king then ordered, "Prepare a saree made of smoke!" Birbal, now in a tricky situation, went home to fetch some clay. His daughter woke him up, saying, "Dad, come and eat!" Birbal replied, "Daughter, after hearing the king's question, I have lost all my hunger and thirst!" When the daughter asked what the king's question was, Birbal explained it to her. The daughter said, "There's no need to panic. Let’s eat first, and before going to the court, we can ask!" 

After eating, Birbal asked his daughter, "Now what should I say?" The daughter suggested, "Go tell the king that 'the saree made of smoke is ready, but it needs a thread of vision!'” When Birbal went to the royal court, he conveyed this message. The king instructed everyone to tie a pot over their eyes to see the thread of vision. When the thread of vision didn’t settle, the king remarked, "Birbal, the vision is not settling!" Birbal then replied, "Your Majesty, if the vision cannot settle, how can the saree made of smoke be ready?" 

The emperor told Birbal, "What’s meant to happen will happen. Let’s see if my kingdom is foolish, crafty, or clever." So Birbal and the emperor set out together. The king held a watch in his hand. As they walked, they saw some boys eating jamun (a type of fruit). The king called to them, "Hey kids, feed me some jamun too!" The boys, from the tree, asked, "Do you want fresh or stale?" The king replied, "Just give me a few of each!" The boys dropped some jamun, and the king blew on them before eating. Then, the boys came down with jamun wrapped in a cloth and handed them to the king. The king gulped them down and asked, "Hey kids, which jamun was stale and which was fresh?" The boys replied, "The ones you blew on are fresh, and the ones you gulped down are stale." The king, while saying this to Birbal, continued walking, exclaiming, "My kingdom is truly clever!"

As the emperor and Birbal continued on their way, they came to a river. There, they asked a man, "How much water is in this river?" The man replied, "You should ask your companion!" The king said, "My companion doesn’t know either. He is also clueless." The man insisted again, "Ask your companion!" The king, not understanding, was scolded by the man, who said, "Your Majesty, can't you measure it with your own stick? If the stick sinks, then you will understand how much water there is!" After hearing this, the king remarked, "My country is very clever!"

As the king moved further, he saw a boy colored in black and asked him, "How much did you spend on dyeing yourself?" The boy replied, "It looks like five annas, but it actually cost me four and a quarter annas! Because they left a patch, and that part was shown to me!" The king and Birbal both were astonished and returned home.
