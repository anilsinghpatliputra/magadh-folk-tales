Once upon a time, two young kings and a minister were wrestling in a arena. At that moment, there was a grand procession in the village. Seeing the procession, the kings and the minister exclaimed, "We are unaware of the wedding. We should ask our parents and discuss it in the arena again tomorrow!" The next day, both arrived at the arena, and the king asked the minister if he was married. The minister replied, "Yes," and the king also mentioned that he would be wed too. They then shared that they should go to their in-laws.

Both friends went to their in-laws, and on the way, when the king reached his in-law's village, he entered a flower garden. There, he saw a girl bathing at a well in the middle of the garden. The king asked the minister, "I want to ask her some questions!" The minister replied, "That's not right. What if she insults you?" 

Nevertheless, the king asked a question:

"What is it, dear, on your lovely forehead?"

"What are those fair locks you are combing?"

"What is it, dear, that you fill water with?"

"What is the long rope you have?"

Upon hearing this, the girl replied:

"I have indeed, dear, a lovely forehead."

"I’m grinding soap with it."

"I also have, dear, a bunch of good mustard."

"I also have water to fill."

"I also have, dear, a silk thread."

"A yellow pot for filling water!"

The king again said:

"Those who adorn your lovely forehead."

"Are made of black and fair clay."

"Those flowing locks, dear, are a bunch of red flowers."

"The water jar is for filling it with water."

"A long rope made of old cloth!"

On hearing this, the girl replied:

"You, too, are the servant of the father of the bride!"

"You must be the son of a trader."

Then the minister said, "Friend, I warned you earlier. If you had listened, you wouldn't have been insulted and called a servant." After this incident, the king and the minister rode off to their in-laws.

The king bowed to his father-in-law and said:

"I am the servant of the father, too, dear sir."

"How should I bow to you?"

Then the father-in-law replied:

"Listen here, you too are a big shot in wealth."

"Who put such talk into your head?"

"Listen and bear in mind! That’s how you will become wealthy!"

After staying in the in-laws for two or four days, the king said he should have a feast. Soon after, the feast was prepared, and the king took his wife with a lot of wealth and dowry. While traveling, they reached a forest near Jagdishpur. There, he sent back all the people of his in-laws and arranged for their transportation. Right there in the forest, he left his wife and rode away on his horses, Nandulal and Hirlal, to rule back home.

Alone in the forest, the queen wailed. The king of Jagdishpur was passing by that way. Hearing the wailing, he went to check and saw a newly married queen with a lot of wealth. He brought her to his palace and wanted to marry her, but the queen said she would marry only after distributing food for twelve years. The king agreed to her condition and built another dharamshala (a resting place for pilgrims). The queen stayed there and began distributing food. Meanwhile, the king’s condition worsened. Elephants and horses started dying, and servants began fleeing.

One day the king asked a Brahmin to read the omens to find out the cause of his sorrow. The holy man said, "You left your married wife; you must think about her!" Hearing this, the king called upon the minister and rode with Hirlal and Nandulal to search for his wife. They reached the dharamshala in Jagdishpur around midnight. Dismounting from their horses, the king and the minister stood still. Hirlal and Nandulal rustled, waking the queen. She got up and said:

"Which pair has come, Nandulal and Hirlal?"

"What misfortune has befallen you?"

"I was left alone in the middle of the forest!"

"There were tigers and lions threatening me!"

Upon hearing all this, the horse spoke:

"Since the day you abandoned Rama, it has all gone to ruin!"

"The kingdom has faced total devastation!"

"All elephants and horses have fallen, O queen!"

"All have perished and been lost!"

"Once, Lord, you gave omens."

"In the omen, your sorrow was reflected!"

"We have come to call you."

"Don't you dare stay, O queen; I am ready to give my life for you!"

Hearing this, the queen said, "Send my lord." Then the horse went to the king and told him about the queen's condition. The king and minister went to her. The minister was quite nervous but finally got ready to give his life up. Then the queen prepared to leave. The king and queen mounted Hirlal and the minister Nandulal and returned to their village. The moment the queen arrived, the king regained all his lost wealth and people. From that day on, the king and queen lived happily and ruled prosperously.
