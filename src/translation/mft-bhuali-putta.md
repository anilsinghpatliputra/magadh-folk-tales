In a village, there was a woman who had a son named 'Bhuvali Putta'. When he grew up, he started going to the fields. She would prepare khichdi (a rice and lentil dish) and take it to him. On the way, she encountered a wild boar. He asked, "Hey old woman, what's in the bowl?" The old woman replied, "There's khichdi in it. I'm taking it for my son Bhuvali!" The boar said, "Give me the khichdi, and clean my snout!" When the old woman placed the khichdi down, the boar ate some and left a mess.

The old woman began to clean the boar's snout, and then she realized he was a big one. After that, she went to Bhuvali Putta. When she gave the khichdi to her son, he asked, "Hey mother, why is this khichdi dirty?" The mother explained everything that happened with the boar. Hearing this, the son said, "Go tell the boar that my Bhuvali Putta has died. He has some work to do on such and such day; that day you all should come for the feast!" The mother began to cry while saying this. When she went one way, she cried, and when she went another way, she laughed. The boar asked her about this, and she explained, "I am crying because I remember my son, and I laugh at the misfortune of my enemies!" Saying this, she returned home.

On the designated day, the old woman placed a pot on the stove and began to let water drip from above. As water fell on the heated pot, it made a sizzling sound. The boars came to eat and asked when they would get to eat. Hearing this, the old woman said, "You boars, you fight among yourselves over food, and I would tie you up in a single place!" All the boars were tied up. Then the old woman said, "Bhuvali Putta, get the stick from the shed!" Bhuvali Putta brought the stick and started hitting all the boars. They all broke free and started to run away, but he managed to hit one boar, breaking its teeth. Finally, when the boar ran back to its group, it said, "You all ran away, so I was coming to eat the pan-bhat (a type of meal)!" Then all the boars replied, "First, take a look at your own teeth!"
