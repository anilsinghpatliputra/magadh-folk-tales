Once, there was a poor Brahmin. He used to eat by begging. In the night, he would beg for a quarter of a seer, and during the day, he would beg for a full seer. One day, the Brahmin's wife said to him, “You work the whole day and night, how do you manage? How do you feed the children?” If he went abroad, he would earn a little and return. The priest said, “Just wait till tomorrow morning.” He asked her to prepare some food. The wife made a dough from the ashes and tied it up. The priest set off for another country with his son. While going, they reached a river and began to worship the water there. Meanwhile, the priest's son took out the dough made from the ashes and began to eat it. The priest saw him and asked, “Did your mother give you this ash dough?” The boy threw the ash dough into the river.

Both of them moved ahead and, walking, reached a mountain. There they saw that no one was around, and kheer (a type of sweet dish) was being prepared. They both cooked the kheer and quickly devoured it. After eating, out of fear, they hid in a hut. After a while, a tiger came and, not seeing the kheer, began to roam around. They didn’t know that this was the tiger's home. From the hut, the boy spotted the tiger and said to his father, “There is a sickle here, let’s hit it with that.” He replied, “Stay quiet or the tiger will eat us both today.” The tiger kept wandering around, wondering who had eaten the kheer? As it roamed, its backside got stuck in the hut’s wall. Meanwhile, the priest's son thrust the sickle into the tiger's backside.

The tiger ran away in pain. It was howling that a sickle had entered its home. Hearing this, a jackal said, “Let me go see who it is.” The jackal came near the hut and poked its snout inside. The priest's son caught the jackal's snout. As the jackal struggled to escape, its snout got stuck too. It also howled as it ran off, claiming that a jackal had entered its home. The frightened tiger and jackal both ran into the jungle and did not dare to return. Then the priest and his son came out of the hut and took all the belongings, and money that other tigers had hidden there, and went home. They told the wife, “Look, dear, we’ve earned this! Now we can sit and eat!”
