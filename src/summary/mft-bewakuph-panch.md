The story is a humorous fable about Baba ji, who, after preparing a feast, accidentally gets involved in a dispute over his wife with a pig. When they both claim her as their own, they take the matter to a local judge (panch). The judge investigates and determines that the wife belongs to the pig based on a unique birthmark. In the end, all three (Baba ji, the pig, and the pig's wife) are left unhappy and crying for different reasons, highlighting the absurdity of the situation and possibly commenting on the nature of ownership and attachment in relationships.
