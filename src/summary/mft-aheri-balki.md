The story revolves around a wealthy king who is deeply saddened by the lack of a son. After isolating himself in his chamber, he vows to remain locked away until someone understands his sorrow. Brahma, taking the form of a sage, promises to understand him, leading the king to a forest where he catches a golden bird that grants him a son after a lengthy wait. Years later, the king's son, enthralled by tales of love, embarks on a hunting adventure and, through celestial intervention, encounters a beautiful maiden. They fall in love but are separated when they are magically returned to their respective places. Their heartfelt longing leads both to seek each other, and with the help of messengers who uncover their stories, they are ultimately united in marriage, leading to a joyous conclusion where they rule the kingdom together.
