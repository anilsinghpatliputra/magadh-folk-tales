The story revolves around a king and his devoted minister, who often expresses the belief that "Whatever God does, does it for the best." After the king accidentally injures his finger while sharpening a sword, he becomes upset and dismisses the minister for repeating his saying during a time of distress. Later, during a hunting expedition, the king is captured by a tribe planning to sacrifice him, but they spare him due to his injury. Upon returning safely, the king realizes the wisdom behind the minister's words and reconciles with him, rewarding him for his loyalty. The minister reveals that had he not been dismissed, he would have accompanied the king and potentially faced the sacrifice himself, highlighting the unforeseen benefits of their earlier misfortune.
