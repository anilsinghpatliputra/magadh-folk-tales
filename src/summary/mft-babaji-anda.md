The story follows a Baba ji who, after receiving funds from his patrons, sends a disciple to buy a horse. The disciple mistakes a horse for a pumpkin and faces a series of comical misadventures, including chasing a rabbit he believes to be a horse's offspring. Each attempt to procure a "horse egg" leads to more ridiculous outcomes, including bringing home a pumpkin that rots or is eaten by rats. Throughout the tale, the Baba ji and his disciples repeatedly misunderstand their situation, culminating in the death of a rat they mistakenly believe is a horse. Ultimately, the Baba ji finds himself humiliated, as the patrons reject him for his foolishness, highlighting themes of misunderstanding, trust, and the absurdity of belief in the improbable.
