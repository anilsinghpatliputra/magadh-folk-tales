The story follows a boy named Bitnava who receives a buffalo from his mother but loses it when it eats from the king's garden and is killed. Seeking revenge, Bitnava cleverly uses the buffalo's skin to scare off thieves, takes their money, and fills his home with riches. However, the king, suspicious of Bitnava's newfound wealth, burns down his house. Bitnava then collects the ashes and inadvertently ends up with a trader's bag filled with jewels after the trader steals his ashes. The king, noticing his wealth again, has Bitnava captured and thrown into a river. Using an elephant to escape, Bitnava ties up the king and throws him into the river, leading to the king's demise. The story ends with Bitnava triumphing over the king and reflects on his experiences.
