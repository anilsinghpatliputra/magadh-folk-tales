The story revolves around four brothers who are left to divide their inheritance after their father's death. When they discover a document stating "four sons and three shares," they seek the help of a moneylender to resolve the dispute. The moneylender devises a plan to discern the brothers' character by inviting them to eat and asking each to tell a story. The first three brothers, eager for their inheritance, leave without eating, while the youngest brother shares a scandalous tale. This angers the moneylender's wife, leading to a humorous confrontation between her and the moneylender.

Ultimately, the moneylender tests the brothers by asking them to urinate on a statue of their father to claim their share. The first three brothers refuse out of respect, but the youngest brother, seeking his portion, does so. The moneylender then declares the youngest brother unworthy of the inheritance, reinforcing the wise notion that the father's statement about their shares was intentional. The story highlights themes of respect, familial bonds, and the consequences of one's actions.
