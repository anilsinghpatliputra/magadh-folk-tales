The story revolves around Birbal, a clever advisor to the emperor, who is faced with an impossible request from the king to prepare a "saree made of smoke." Birbal cleverly navigates the situation with the help of his daughter's insightful suggestion, telling the king that the saree requires a "thread of vision." As the king attempts to see this thread, Birbal uses the opportunity to highlight the absurdity of the demand. 

The narrative demonstrates various encounters on a journey where the emperor initially seeks to test the intelligence of his subjects. They meet boys who differentiate fresh from stale fruit based on a humorous observation, a man who cleverly suggests a practical solution to measure water in a river, and a boy who discusses the cost of dyeing his skin with unexpected precision. Throughout, Birbal's wit stands out, and the king realizes that his kingdom is filled with clever and resourceful individuals. The story emphasizes intelligence, wit, and the importance of practical thinking over mere authority.
