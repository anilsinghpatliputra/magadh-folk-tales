The story revolves around a woman and her son, Bhuvali Putta, living in a village. The mother regularly brings food to her son in the fields but encounters a demanding wild boar that makes her clean its snout after it eats her food. This encounter leads her to tell the boar that her son has died and invites the boar and its friends for a feast. 

On the feast day, the mother cleverly ties up all the boars and instructs Bhuvali Putta to use a stick to hit them as they attempt to escape. Although most boars flee, one gets injured. The story concludes with the injured boar humorously being chastised by the others for not being mindful of its own damaged teeth, suggesting the consequences of its greed and hinting at the motherï¿½s cunning nature. Overall, the tale combines elements of wit, family loyalty, and playful justice.
