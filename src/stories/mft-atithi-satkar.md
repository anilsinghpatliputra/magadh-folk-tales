<blockquote>
The story revolves around a man who sees himself as an emperor but is inherently stingy and reluctant to host guests. When an old friend visits, he initially acts warmly and nostalgically, but when it comes to hospitality, he suggests that the friend should indulge himself at a nearby sweet shop instead of sharing a meal with him. This illustrates the man's self-centered nature and reluctance to truly share or give, despite appearing cordial.

एगो अदमी अपना के भारी शहंशाह समझऽ हलक, बाकि ऊ हलक भारी कंजूस। से ओकरा हीं कोय अतिथि जदि आवऽ हलक, त ऊ ओकरा कोय-न-कोय बहाना बना के टरका देऽ हलक।

एक तुरी ओकर एगो बड़ा पुराना इयार ओकर घरे आयल। अयला पर ऊ ओकरा अप्पन बैठका में बैठयलक,  ओकर कुसल-क्षेम पुछलक आउ बचपन के इयाद करके हँसी-मजाक कयलक। ओकरा पैर धोवे ला ऊ पानी भी मंगवैलक। 

भोर के बेरिया हल। जब बात-चीत करइत कुछ समइया बीत गेल, तऽ अप्पन बोली में असीम प्यार भर के ऊ कहलक- '’आज एकादसी हवऽ। हमनी हीं सबके उपवास हवऽ।'’ कल रात के कुछ बासी बचल तऽ हे, बाकि तूं बसिया तो खैबऽ नऽ। से ई घरवा से निकलला पर अगलके मोड़ पर बंसी हलवाई के दूकान हवऽ। से तूं उहाँ कचौरी-जलेबी भरपेट जरूर खालिहऽ, तोरा हम्मर किरिया!''

A man considered himself a great emperor, but he was actually quite stingy. Whenever a guest arrived at his place, he would always find some excuse to send them away.

One day, an old friend of his visited him. When he arrived, the man welcomed him into his sitting room, inquired about his well-being, and reminisced about their childhood, sharing laughter and jokes. He even had water brought to wash his feet.

It was early morning. After some time spent in conversation, he said with immense love in his voice, "Today is Ekadashi. We all are supposed to fast." There are some leftovers from last night, but you haven't eaten any, have you? So, just after leaving this house, there's a halwai (sweet shop) at the next turn. You must go there and fill yourself up with kachoris and jalebis, that’s my request to you!"
