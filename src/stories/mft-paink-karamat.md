<blockquote>
The story revolves around a banker who deceives a village by making false claims about his possessions. He boasts about having thirteen oxen but admits to having none of value, misleading the villagers about the condition of the animals. Similarly, he exaggerates his wealth in rice, gold, textiles, and other resources while the reality reveals a lack of quality and worth in what he owns. The repeated emphasis on his deceitful claims contrasts sharply with the reality he witnesses, ultimately highlighting the banker's dishonesty and manipulation.

एक ठो पैंक हल। ऊ एगो बस्ती में गेल। उहाँ कहलक कि हमरा तेरह हर के बैल हे, बाछी-पोछी के लेखा नऽ हे। इहाँ आ के देखलक कि बाड़ी-बाछी हे, जे अइसन चोता हगऽ हे, कि अँगनो लीपे भर नऽ हे। बड़ा दगा देलक पैंक! 
कह गेल पैंक कि तेरह कोठी चाउर हे, कोठा-खुद्दी के लेखा-जोखा नऽ हे। आँख से देखली - पइला पर धान, माँड़ो चुअऽ नऽ हे ! बड़ा दगा देलन पैंक! 
कह गेलन पैंक कि सोना-रूपा ढेर हे, काँसा-पीत्तर के लेखा-जोखा नऽ हे। आँखि देखवलन कि फुटली छिपनिया, कि पनियो रहे योग नऽ हे। बड़ा दगा देलन हो पैंक! 

कह गेलन पैंक कि तेरह थान लूगा हे, फाटल-पुरान के लेखा-जोखा नऽ हे। आँखि देखवलन फटली लुगरिया, जे पेंवनो साटे जोग नऽ हे। बड़ा दगा देलऽ हो पैंक॥

A certain banker went to a village. There, he said that he had thirteen oxen but there were no calves or young ones. Upon coming here, he saw that there were plenty of young ones, but they were so thin that it was hard to tell if they were even worth keeping. The banker deceived greatly!

The banker said there were thirteen rooms of rice, but there were no records of the room measurements. With his own eyes, he saw - there were wet rice grains on the floor, and the fresh paddy was nowhere to be found! The banker deceived greatly!

The banker proclaimed that there was plenty of gold and silver, but there were no records of brass and stone. He showed with his own eyes that the broken utensils were such that they weren't even usable. The banker deceived greatly!

The banker said there were thirteen pieces of cloth, but there were no records of torn or old cloth. With his own eyes, he showed worn-out cloth that was not even fit to be stitched together. The banker deceived greatly!
